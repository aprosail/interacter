# EOL (end-of-line) normalization to avoid potential merge conflict
# when cross-platform collaboration is required. Windows uses CRLF as EOL,
# while Unix-like systems including macOS and Linux uses LF.
# The EOL character is invisible that it's might be confused
# when such merge conflict occurs.
